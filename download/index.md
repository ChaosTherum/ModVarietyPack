Only compatible with version Alpha12d of Rimworld.           
Needs to be run in English.    
Using additional mods is not recommended.

## Installation Windows:

1. Go to the folder you installed the game in. (*gamefolder*)    
Delete all mods inside your *Mods* folder except *Core*.  

2. Open up the downloaded ModPack .zip file. Open the *ModVarietyPack-x.xx* folder    
Extract everything in there to your *gamefolder* (2 folders (Mods + SaveData) and 2 files (readme + setup file)

3. Run the Setup_ModVarietyPack file. This will create a new shortcut for you.    

4. To play with the modpack enabled, start the game with the new shortcut. Your savegames for the modpack will be in the new *savedata* folder. If you want to play vanilla RimWorld, start the game with the original .exe file. Your savegames for the vanilla game will be in *C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld* as usual. 

5. Exit the game and restart it.     
Unfortunately this is necessary after a change to the mod order. The game needs a restart for all mods to function correctly.

6. Have fun <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>   

> If (for whatever reason) the shortcut/script does not work for you, you can copy the modconfig.xml from the savedata folder to *C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld\Config* overriding the one that is there. Then just start the game with the original .exe file.   



## Installation Mac:

1. Delete all mods inside your *Mods* folder except *Core*.     
You can find your *Mods* folder by right-clicking on your application - Show Package Contents.      
The *Mods* folder is in there.

2. Delete the *Saves*, *Worlds*, and *Config* folders. (Warning: This deletes all your previous colonies!)      
You can find these folders here:     
/Users/[username]/library/Application Support/Rimworld

3. Run the game once without any mods installed to make sure it is running properly, this will also generate a fresh *Config* folder.

4. Open up the downloaded ModPack .zip file. You will see a *Mods* folder and a *SavaData* folder.    
Extract everything in the *Mods* folder to your own *Mods* folder.    
In the *SaveData* folder you can find a file named *ModConfig.xml*.    
Extract that to your *Config* folder found here:    
/Users/[username]/library/Application Support/Rimworld    
This will override the old ModsConfig file with the one needed to run this modpack.   

5. Exit the game and restart it.     
Unfortunately this is necessary after a change to the mod order. The game needs a restart for all mods to function correctly.

6. Have fun <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
