One of the best mods for RimWorld is undoubtedly the [MAI mod](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=3612.0) by Haplo.   
While the actual MAIs are awesome, I especially enjoyed the little bots that came with the mod. The little cleaner bot and the flying hauler-copter were life savers in a few of my colonies.   

With the latest release of the mod, Haplo made it pretty easy to add new types of those robot helpers. So I had some fun with robots and came up with 3 new models:    
* Cooking bot
* Farmer bot 
* Crafting bot  
* Mining bot

The cookbot and farmbot (+ their recharge stations) are shown in the picture above. There is also a new texture for the cleaning bot and new charging stations.    

I also came up with new recipes + research projects to make all the bots craftable. I hope it's reasonably balanced because these bots are really powerful. Having said that, I was wondering if the MAIs themselves made sense to keep and I think going with these little bots is better for the overall experience. They are easy to handle, have their own bed /recharge station and don't clutter up the colonist lists.  

All that and more in the new v.1.25!
